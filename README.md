# Checklist app

Purpose of creating a checklist app is to learn the fundamentals in React and its ecosystem. Add options to the checklist and remove them. A "What Should I Do?" button added to randomly select one of the options to do. In this app I was able to implement the following:

1. Think in React Components.
2. Components Props vs State.
3. Create Stateless Functional Components.
4. Setup Babel and SCSS with Webpack.
5. Integrate a Third-Party Component. (React Modal)
